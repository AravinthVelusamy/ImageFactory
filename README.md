##Description

ImageFactory is much like BitmapFactory but returns GifDrawable if decoded image is an animated GIF or BitmapDrawable if not.
Has AnimatableImageView that handles Animatable background and image lifecycle and AnimatableDelegate to easily implement Animatable handling on any View.

Work in progress. Has some bugs.

Min API level 7
